## Importing Images

The first step is to find pictures of fruits and get them into your notebook so you can use them in your project.

 You can do this by finding an image online, copying it, and pasting it into a cell. Try searching for 'fruit icons' and choosing five of your favorite fruits. Alternatively, you can use these images.

Use `ImageResize` to resize all of your images so that they are 50 pixel squares.

Now make a list of your fruits.

When you run the code for `ImageResize`, the output will be the resized image. You can click on the resized image and copy it into your list.

Lists start with `{` and end with `}`, and each element is separated by a `,`.
Assign this list to the variable name `fruits`.
