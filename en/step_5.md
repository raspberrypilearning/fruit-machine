## Challenge: Improve the Interface

Add more elements to your interface design. Maybe you could incorporate the option to have either a random choice without considering sentiment, or a sentiment based choice? You could add some instructions or experiment with graphics and Text Styling. You could make up different possible outputs for each classification.
